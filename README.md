Summary of the Project: **Distributed Intelligence over Urban Air Pollution**

The project focuses on the calculation of the Air Quality Index (AQI) and comparison of data obtained from Live Streaming Sensor Data

as a part of distributed intelligence to create awareness among the people. 

Here, the machine learning strategies are utilized to 
  
  calculate the AQI and the relation among the other atmospheric components in the dataset and also to analyse how relative humidity 
  
  and solar radiation get affected based on the pollutants present in the atmosphere.
  
**The scope of the project is to obtain sensor data from sites and to calculate, compare and visualize the data.**

Comparison of Pollution Levels in Chennai at **Velachery and Perungudi( Using 3 month dataset)**.

Comparison of Pollution Levels in **Chennai and Coimbatore( Using 1 year dataset)**.



**Operating System:** Windows 7

**Front End:** JUPYTER Notebook IDE

**Files:** CSV files (Comma Separated Values)

**Python 3 Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn, etc.

**Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, etc.

**AQI Calculation: Ii = [{(IHI - ILO)/(BHI -BLO)} * (Cp-BLO)]+ ILO**
